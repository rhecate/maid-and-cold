what does the master want her to look for

chocograph-esque main progress items
	with chocographs, you find them via hot and cold and they give you a treasure map esque secondary task to find more item / make progress that lets you go to a new area

- sentimental photograph
- grandmother's recipe
- favorite scarf
- worn stuffed rabbit

dialogue with the master when you find a main progress item


start:

	the bored master commands the maid to search for an item he has lost
		- this is his bedroom and its messy as fuck
		- she will have to spend a long time digging through all of his shit
		- he will not tell her what she's looking for. he'll let her know when she finds it.
	
	why is his room messy when there are maids?
		- he has been doing things he wants kept private and has not allowed the maids to enter his room for several days
		- he is not done with this private task, but he can't find an item necessary to continue with it
		- for some reason, fillie is the one maid he will allow inside
	
	


	- fillie walks onto the upper level from an unseen room on the left
	- palace is sitting in his famous chair and orders her to come down to see him

conclusion:

	some level of closeness is achieved between the master and maid
	the maid gains knowledge of the master's personal life
	the masters vulnerability is exposed and the maid gains leverage
